# Color Stack
Color Stack is a small Kotlin Multiplatform Project to explore some of the advanced animation capabilites offered by Compose Mulitplatform.

# What does Color Stack offer?
* Everytime a color value is set, a new card falls from the top into the stack with rotation and translation animations.
* Switch between multiple Color formats using a Segmented Control.
* Supports the following Color formats -
  * RGB
  * HSL
  * HSV
* Sliders to adjust values of the color's components. Make it rain cards by sliding along.
* Add/Subtract discrete values from the color's components using the button beside the slider.
* Toss a card off the stack using the POP Button.
